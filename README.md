MIPS-Corruption-Resistance
==========================
Contains a Python script that allows to create a verification vector, using the "multi-lock" method described in
<<<<<<< HEAD
Software-Only Fault-Protected MIPS Programs presented in CHES'2016.
This vector allows to protect a MIPS program against alterations on up to three instructions

How To Use It :
Input => The MIPS program in hexadecimal code (one instruction per line)
Output => outputP.hex, which contains the hexadecimal program with the vector.
